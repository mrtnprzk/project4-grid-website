                    looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
                    amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                    found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                    weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                    completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working
